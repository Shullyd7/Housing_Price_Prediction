# Housing_Price_Prediction

This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict median house values based on various features such as longitude, latitude, housing_median_age, total_rooms, total_bedrooms, population, households and median_income. After cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, the data is split into training and testing sets. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared are calculated to assess the model's accuracy and explain the variance in the predictions. Finally, A map is used to compare actual versus predicted values.
